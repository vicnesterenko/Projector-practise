### Welcome to my first Python tasks repository! üêç


Homework tasks from Projector Institute Python Beginning course - [Link for course](https://prjctr.com/course/python-beginning) 

- This Git repository houses the Python tasks I completed during the Projector Python Beginning Course. 
Here, you will find a collection of Python scripts and code snippets that showcase my progress and learning journey as I delved into the fundamentals of Python programming.

### **<p align="center">Algo-Riddles: The Coding Conundrum Task</p>**
- **Main task:** You have 100 cats. One day you decide to arrange all your cats in a giant circle. Initially, none of your cats have any hats on. You walk around the circle 100 times, always starting at the same spot, with the first cat (cat # 1). Every time you stop at a cat, you either put a hat on it if it doesn‚Äôt have one on, or you take its hat off if it has one on. In the first round, you stop at every cat, placing a hat on each one. In The second round, you only stop at every second cat (#2, #4, #6, #8, etc.). In The third round, you only stop at every third cat(#3, #6, #9, #12, etc.). You continue this process until you‚Äôve made 100 rounds around the cats (e.g., you only visit the 100th cat). Write a program that simply outputs which cats have hats at the end.
- **Optional task:** Make a function that can calculate hats with any amount of rounds and cats.
